# TrolleyPro

TrolleyPro is a Flutter-based shopping cart application designed for a seamless shopping experience. It integrates with the Fake Store API to fetch products and provides robust state management using the Provider package. Users can browse products, view details, add items to their cart, and manage their purchases effortlessly.

- Fetch and display products from the Fake Store API.
- Each product includes an image, title, price, and description.
2. Product Details
- View detailed information about a selected product.
- Add the product to the cart directly from the details screen.
3. Shopping Cart
- Add products to the cart.
- Remove products individually or clear the entire cart.
- View the total price of items in the cart.
- Simulate checkout functionality.
4. State Management
- Uses the Provider package for managing cart state across the app.
